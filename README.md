This block covers Document Object Model (DOM).

## Demonstrates use of: .querySelector, .appendChild, .replaceChildren, Math.floor, Math.random, .toFixed(), .length, objects, arrays, for/of loop, .map, .reduce, .push, .setAttribute, setInterval, .createElement, .innerText, .innerHTML, Object.keys().

## Challenges:

This workshop was relatively easy to navigate as I spent more time visualizing the DOM and using the Inspect tool with console.log to see how the HTML was being built out. I did face challenges when it came to updating the average price everytime a new freelancer was added to the freelancer array. After some troubleshooting, I was able to break down the priceDiv into a few different ways so that the price could be re-rendered.
