# Block 19 Workshop: Freelancer Forum

In this workshop, you will create a platform where independent freelancers can advertise their services.

## Requirements

Build your website according to this user story:

> A visitor enters the website and finds a list of available freelancers. Each freelancer has a name, an occupation,
> and a starting price for their services. They observe on the list Alice, the writer with a starting price of $30, and
> Bob, who is a teacher, has a starting price of $50.
>
> The visitor also finds a message that displays the average starting price of all the freelancers. In this example,
> the average starting price is $40.
>
> A few seconds later, a new listing appears for a freelancer named Carol, who is a programmer and has a starting
> price of $70. The average starting price is updated to $50.
>
> New freelancers continue to appear every few seconds, and the average starting price is updated accordingly

## Getting Started

There is no starter code for this workshop. However, the solution is very similar to the Shapes guided practice. You are encouraged to use that repository as a starting point for this workshop.

1. Create a new repository named Unit2.FreelancerForum on GitHub and clone it down.
2. Open the project with VS Code and create an HTML file and a JavaScript file.
3. Figure out a plan for what code you will need to write based on the user story. Use the rubric to guide you.

## Hints

Example freelancers array:

```js
const freelancers = [
  { name: "Dr. Slice", price: 25, occupation: "gardener" },
  { name: "Dr. Pressure", price: 51, occupation: "programmer" },
  { name: "Prof. Possibility", price: 43, occupation: "teacher" },
  { name: "Prof. Prism", price: 81, occupation: "teacher" },
  { name: "Dr. Impulse", price: 43, occupation: "teacher" },
  { name: "Prof. Spark", price: 76, occupation: "programmer" },
  { name: "Dr. Wire", price: 47, occupation: "teacher" },
  { name: "Prof. Goose", price: 72, occupation: "driver" },
];
```
